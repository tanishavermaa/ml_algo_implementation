    "Q1. What is Gradient Boosting Regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient Boosting Regression is a machine learning algorithm that is used for regression tasks. It belongs to the family of boosting algorithms and is designed to create a strong predictive model by sequentially combining multiple weak learners (typically decision trees) to improve predictive accuracy. It works by fitting each weak learner to the residuals (the differences between the true target values and the current model's predictions) of the previous model, thus iteratively reducing the error and improving the overall regression model.\n",

    "\n",
    "Q2. What is a weak learner in Gradient Boosting?\n",
    "\n",
    "A weak learner in the context of Gradient Boosting is a simple, relatively low-complexity model that performs slightly better than random chance on a classification or regression task. Weak learners are often shallow decision trees with limited depth, linear models, or other basic models. In Gradient Boosting, the algorithm combines multiple weak learners to form a strong learner by sequentially focusing on the errors made by the previous models.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. What is the intuition behind the Gradient Boosting algorithm?\n",
    "\n",
    "The intuition behind the Gradient Boosting algorithm is to build a strong predictive model by correcting the mistakes of the previous models. It does this by iteratively training weak learners and adjusting their predictions based on the errors made by the ensemble so far. The idea is to reduce the prediction errors (residuals) at each step, gradually improving the model's accuracy until it converges to a strong learner that minimizes the overall error. Gradient Boosting is guided by the gradient of the loss function, hence the name.\n",

    "Q4. How does the Gradient Boosting algorithm build an ensemble of weak learners?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Gradient Boosting algorithm builds an ensemble of weak learners sequentially by following these steps:\n",
    "Train the first weak learner on the original data.\n",
    "Calculate the residuals (differences between true target values and the predictions of the current model) for each data point.\n",
    "Train the next weak learner on the residuals, with the goal of reducing these residuals.\n",
    "Update the ensemble's prediction by adding the prediction of the new weak learner, weighted by a learning rate.\n",
    "Repeat steps 2-4 for a fixed number of iterations or until a stopping criterion is met.\n",
    "The final prediction is the weighted sum of all weak learners' predictions, which together form a strong ensemble model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. What are the steps involved in constructing the mathematical intuition of Gradient Boosting algorithm?\n",
    "\n",
    "The mathematical intuition behind Gradient Boosting involves several steps:\n",
    "Initialize the model as a constant value, typically the mean of the target variable.\n",
    "Calculate the residuals by subtracting the initial model's predictions from the true target values.\n",
    "Train a weak learner (e.g., decision tree) to fit the residuals, aiming to minimize the loss function.\n",
    "Calculate the negative gradient of the loss function with respect to the residuals. This gradient represents how the loss would change if the predictions were adjusted.\n",
    "Update the model by adding the prediction of the weak learner, weighted by a learning rate, which is a small positive value. This step adjusts the model to reduce the residuals.\n",
    "Repeat steps 2-5 for a fixed number of iterations or until a stopping criterion is met.\n",
    "The final prediction is the sum of the initial constant value, the weighted contributions of all weak learners, and the learning rate adjustments. This ensemble of weak learners forms the strong predictive model.\n",
    "The key idea is that each weak learner focuses on the errors made by the previous models, and by iteratively correcting these errors, the ensemble gradually improves and converges to a strong predictive model.\n",
